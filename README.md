# Dodge the Falling Blocks
Much like the name suggests, this is a game about dodging falling blocks. \
My hello_pygame.



## 🚀 How do I run it?
First, install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) which is an extremely fast and easy to use package and project manager.
You can so either from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):
```bash
# Using pip
pip install uv
# Using pipx
pipx install uv
```
or from AUR if you're using Arch, via `yay -S uv`. \
<i>or just follow the installation procedures mentioned [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).</i>


Clone the repository and navigate to the folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souhail-Bel/hello_pygame
cd hello_pygame
```

Next, we get the virtual environment set up by running:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then, whenever you want to run it, simply type:

```bash
uv run play
```
